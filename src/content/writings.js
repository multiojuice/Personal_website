### The start of some new things
I suppose that new habits are not always good, but I think that some new things that I am trying out are. Last week, I realized that I was coming home from my job around, ehhh, 5:30ish and then just coasting throughout the whole rest of the night. As nice as it is to just coast, it is quite desirable for some people, I think it was making me unhappy. So here are some things that I decided might pick up my days.

### Writing everyday
People forget a lot of things, most things actually.. and I recently remembered that we forget most things because of my "memories" in Snapchat. Your memories are a feature based around taking one of your snaps and saving it to memories so that it can be accessed whenever, unlike most snaps, which get deleted upon sending (I think). Your memories on the same day but from the previous years are dispalyed to you and it is pretty great to see amazing moments of your life that you were just on the verge of forgetting. 
> So, I guess that this section of my website is going to just be a place for myself to document things that are important to me or things that will make me smile in a year or so.

It is kind of exciting to do this, I am planning to do it for a \`bit\`, but hopefully I can entertain myself for more than a \`bit\`.

### Waking up earlier
It is not that I sleep to much, I just heard something once that said something like the morning is for productivity and the night is for slacking off. As much as I work late at night, I do get distracted \`nightly\` things, and I was thinking that I should sleep the same amount, but shift the wake-up and lay-down periods a few hours earlier. So rather than like 2am-8:40am, try 11pm-6am. Who slacks off at 6 in the morning? Seems hard to do that, so I am going to give this a shot..

### Swimming
I usually keep pretty in-shape, but I had surgery two months ago and I have been hesitant to return to the gym after feeling a \`bit\` of pain in that area, so now instead of doing nothing, I am going to enjoy the San Diego weather and try to swim everyday as half workout, half relax.

### Reading everyday
I want to start reading, I actually have the past 2 weeks, practically everynight. So, I decided to commit to continuing this. Specifically, I started reading the Bible and I think that I might just be reading that for the next while. There are so many parts of it that I just have no idea about, and I feel nobody else does either (but many people do). Regardless of your faith, the Bible has been so interesting and forces the reader to reflect on themselves and the day, and I would suggest looking into a chapter or two.

### Programming
This one is probably the easiest out of the things I stated above. I want to program everyday. Programming at work doesn't count though. I have already been doing this pretty well, only missing a handful of days in the last 2 and a half months.
> I am a creator and as long as I can think of things to create, I will be using programming as my medium to build these ideas.

### Finishing thoughts
It is hard to finish things, and it is easy to start things, but I want to get passionate about continuing these habits and since I have been doing it, \`two whole days\`, my days were pretty great. It is much easier to stick to good things and all I want is to have these be good things : )

### Preface
I have been applying to multiple companies looking for an internship over the next summer, but it is hard to display my passion or push for learning over a cover letter or one page resume. So far everything I write I cannot focus on my true feelings or thought about myself and my experiences because I am focusing on making them sound not fake, even though they aren't. I'm talking about learning outside of work and school on my own everyday, programming side projects, pushing my friends to work with me, or just getting my co-workers fired up about technology; on paper it all seems fake :(

### I have grown
What is the point of learning things you won't use??? So you can use it later! Duh!! I realized over the past year how much I have grown and how little tools and information I have. I can always make something work, it might not be pretty, fast, or small, but it will work. However, I have been trying to get rid of that attitude over the past few months. Instead I look into new technoligies I can leverage to improve my creations and ideas. Last year I was using the file system to communicate between programs and services I wrote (I know, so bad lol), but now I know several different ways to applications can talk to eachother. Not sure where this paragraph is going.

### How do I display this?
I am still not sure, in time, and with responses from employers, I am sure that I can make edits to my summaries to display how I actually am. I am going to make edits and finish this out tomorrow. I am tired.

### The Albums

> Lush - Snail Mail
> When I think Of You In A Castle - Post Animal
> Room on Fire - The Strokes
> Swimming - Mac Miller
> A Flourish and Spoil - The Districts

### Preface
I am talking about those albums... those albums that you just cycle through. The other day, I listened to *Colour Flow* ~7 times in a row and only stopped because I felt that could be weird. I turned them off, just to go and listen to *Lush* 3 times in a row. I know other people do this, but I am not too picky about my music, so I am now curious to why I have been listening to these so much.

### Outside influence
Well, I have a feeling that Spotify is a large part of it. When you open the app it has right at the top in huge letters, 'Your Heavy rotation', which when I see all my favorite albums literally one click away, why would I ever search for other music? Recently, I haven't had the same amount of time I have had in the past to just search for new artists and potential albums that I would actually buy (see next section), so the only ways I really find new music is from Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist. The problem with this is that I like to listen to albums when I listen to music.

### When the rotation rotates...
Albums slowly fall out of this rotation as new ones come in, however I always buy the albums that come into the rotation. I buy a vinyl copy so that I will always have a physical copy of this album. Not because I will never be able to listen to it again in the future, with the internet I will always be able to find them. But because I will probalby forget this master piece that I have listened to countless times and if I need to lug it around in a crate to everywhere I move, that album will always be available to remember and listen to again.

### Why I listen to only albums
##### Pros of Albums
What I mean by this is that, in my humble opinion, music is best consumed in the form of an album. An album, if it is could, usually sounds like a complete thought or an adventure. It should lead you places, pull you back out of them, then surprise you, or something along these lines; while having a sweet sound at the same of course. 

##### Cons of Playlists
Sadly a playlist is usually just a mashup of all different thoughts that don't piece together like the artist of the songs intended them to. If you find a playlist which has songs all on the same page, like all happy songs about dogs, then throughout that whole listening experience that happy feelign will just numb out; if there are sad dog songs mixed in the correct way, your mood can be almost reset.

##### Cons of listening song by song
A song is like a sentence in a paragraph or maybe even a sentence in an entire book, depending on what Album the song comes from. If you pull a song out of an album, it is like reading just that one sentence from the book; you will have absolutely no idea what context the piece was written in. Is this the triumph of the hero's story? Or maybe the success they had before their decline into sadness? If an artist offers this context, why would I skip out on it. I am always down for understanding something in the way it was meant to be understood in.

### Thanks for coming :)
