# Beginnings
### The start of some new things
I suppose that new habits are not always good, but I think that some new things that I am trying out are. Last week, I realized that I was coming home from my job around, ehhh, 5:30ish and then just coasting throughout the whole rest of the night. As nice as it is to just coast, it is quite desirable for some people, I think it was making me unhappy. So here are some things that I decided might pick up my days.

##### Writing everyday
People forget a lot of things, most things actually.. and I recently remembered that we forget most things because of my "memories" in Snapchat. Your memories are a feature based around taking one of your snaps and saving it to memories so that it can be accessed whenever, unlike most snaps, which get deleted upon sending (I think). Your memories on the same day but from the previous years are dispalyed to you and it is pretty great to see amazing moments of your life that you were just on the verge of forgetting. 
> So, I guess that this section of my website is going to just be a place for myself to document things that are important to me or things that will make me smile in a year or so.

It is kind of exciting to do this, I am planning to do it for a \`bit\`, but hopefully I can entertain myself for more than a \`bit\`.

##### Waking up earlier
It is not that I sleep to much, I just heard something once that said something like the morning is for productivity and the night is for slacking off. As much as I work late at night, I do get distracted \`nightly\` things, and I was thinking that I should sleep the same amount, but shift the wake-up and lay-down periods a few hours earlier. So rather than like 2am-8:40am, try 11pm-6am. Who slacks off at 6 in the morning? Seems hard to do that, so I am going to give this a shot..

##### Swimming
I usually keep pretty in-shape, but I had surgery two months ago and I have been hesitant to return to the gym after feeling a \`bit\` of pain in that area, so now instead of doing nothing, I am going to enjoy the San Diego weather and try to swim everyday as half workout, half relax.

##### Reading everyday
I want to start reading, I actually have the past 2 weeks, practically everynight. So, I decided to commit to continuing this. Specifically, I started reading the Bible and I think that I might just be reading that for the next while. There are so many parts of it that I just have no idea about, and I feel nobody else does either (but many people do). Regardless of your faith, the Bible has been so interesting and forces the reader to reflect on themselves and the day, and I would suggest looking into a chapter or two.

##### Programming
This one is probably the easiest out of the things I stated above. I want to program everyday. Programming at work doesn't count though. I have already been doing this pretty well, only missing a handful of days in the last 2 and a half months.
> I am a creator and as long as I can think of things to create, I will be using programming as my medium to build these ideas.

#### Finishing thoughts
It is hard to finish things, and it is easy to start things, but I want to get passionate about continuing these habits and since I have been doing it, \`two whole days\`, my days were pretty great. It is much easier to stick to good things and all I want is to have these be good things : )
